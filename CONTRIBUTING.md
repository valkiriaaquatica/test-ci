## How to Contribute New Code

We welcome your contributions! Please follow the steps below to ensure consistency and CI compatibility:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Test your changes locally

Before submitting any code, make sure it works as expected by testing it locally.

Follow the steps in our [Development Guide](https://github.com/valkiriaaquatica/provider-proxmox-bpg?tab=readme-ov-file#developing) to run and test the provider on your machine.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new branch

Use a meaningful name and follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for branches:

```bash
# For a bug fix
git checkout -b fix(my-feature):short-description

# For a new feature
git checkout -b feat(my-feature):short-description
```

> üìù Use only lowercase for `fix`, `feat`, etc. Keep the branch name short and descriptive.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Make your changes and commit properly

Follow the **Conventional Commits** standard when writing your commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "fix(my-feature): fix crash when API token is empty"
```

**Examples:**

* `feat(api): add support for token-based auth`
* `fix(vm): correct VM clone logic on large disks`
* `docs(readme): clarify dev setup instructions`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Commits that don‚Äôt follow the Conventional Commit standard will **fail CI checks**.


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Re-run CI on failure due to external issues

After pushing your changes, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the CI pipeline.

If the pipeline fails due to **external issues** (e.g., network, authentication, infrastructure), you can **re-run the failed workflows from the Pull Request by commenting**:

* `/rerun-all` ‚Üí Re-run **all failed workflows**
* `/rerun-workflow <workflow name>` ‚Üí Re-run a **specific failed workflow**

> This is powered by [`estroz/rerun-actions`](https://github.com/estroz/rerun-actions). Only repo contributors or PRs with the `ok-to-test` label can trigger reruns this way.
